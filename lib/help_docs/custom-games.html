  <h1>Custom Games</h1>
  
  <h3>How They Work</h3>
  <p>
   Custom games work by swapping out the contents of the game's saved game folder with the
   contents of the profile's folder. This means that you can create a custom game for any
   game that has a save game folder that contains only save game data and <b>not</b>
   other necessary game files.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you activate a profile all the files inside the game's saved game folder are moved
   into the profile folder of the previously active profile. Then all the files inside
   the folder of the profile being activated are moved into the save game folder.

  <p>
   <b>Name</b>, this is what will appear in the game's as its name.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Directory</b>, the folder that contains the saves folder and does/will contain
   the profile folder.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Exe</b>, this is the program that will be run when the custom game is launched.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Profile Folder</b>, the name of the folder inside the directory that will
   contain the profiles.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Saves Folder</b>, the name of the folder inside the directory that contains
   the game's saved game data.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Icon</b>, this is the icon that will be displayed for the game on its tab.
   This should be between 16 x 16px and 18 x 18px in size.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Setting Up Profiles</h3>
  <p>
   The auto create profiles function for custom games will create a profile for every folder
   inside the game's saved game folder and the profile folder. It will <b>not</b> sort existing
   saved games into folders. There are two ways to set up profiles, both require manually sorting
   the saved games:<br/>
   <b>1)</b> Go into the game's saved game folder and create a new folder for each character.
   Then moved the saved games into their respective folder. Once finished run auto create profiles.<br/>
   <b>2)</b> Create a new profile inside the Profile Manager for each character. Then
   move the saved games from the saved game folder into the respective profile folder.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Importing &amp; Exporting</h3>
  <p>
   Custom games can be exported and imported into an XML file format. This allows for them to
   be backed-up and exchanged between users. When a game is imported from another user
   the directory and exe may need to be updated to reflect their location on your current
   machine. When exporting to share with other, if you are using a custom icon be sure
   to include it when sending the file to others.
